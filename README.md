# Question Bank Scraper

Hi! This is a small project to collect as many questions from the official formative assessment bank. It should work seamlessly with as little user interaction as possible. You can also benefit from the project by viewing the questions and answers collected on the [discussion forum](https://doplgangr.github.io/databasescraper/question.html).

As of now, we need your kind input to make this happen. We need _your help_ to collect as many questions as possible.
